  </h3>
  <div class=fancy>
    <p>
    But here are a few anyway ;)
    <ul>
      <a><img src="img/bp.jpg"alt="picture of the show, Blood+">
      This anime is about a teenage girl trying to uphold her social life while trying to keep her secret mission. <href="https://tubitv.com/series/300007089/blood?start=true" Just in case you were interested> 
      </a>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <a><img src="img/AC.jpg"alt="picture of the show, Assassination Classroom">
        This, hands down, is most definately in my top 10 favorites. This show stars a creature that was given the oportunity to teach a middle school classroom a little more than academics.
